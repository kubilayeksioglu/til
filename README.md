- Things that are easier to happen, tends to happen more often, tautologically. 
- Exploitative systems do not last for long. 
- Easiest way to remove miscommunication is to set expectations clearly.
- Your biggest cost will always be salaries. Delay hiring until you have funding (or income).
- It's always cheaper to buy, instead of to build (or host). Because you have no idea if what you're building would stick. Additionally most tools are per head, and when you've small number of people cost is small as well.
- If you have funding, hire to decrease your workload, not to increase your capacity. Keeping your team at 80% capacity and allowing people a 20% margin to improve their work makes wonders. Example: If you have a task that would take 4 days, give people 5 days. Your team members would use that 1 day to (re)think about task and perfect their craft. 
- If everyone is working at full capacity, they cannot grow. You need to allow your team to explore, instead of full exploitation.
- You should always look for hires, even if you're not hiring. Similar to customers, you need a hiring pipeline. Otherwise, one of your team members will leave and you'll be in a tough position. In these moments, you'll be thankful previous relatively light workloads because your team will still have one more gear to use.
- It's cheaper to make your current employees happy, rather than finding new ones. On average, a new employee will take 3 months to reach their 4th gear.
- Create scenarios where your team improves themselves, and creates value. This only happens when task is challenging, and people are allowed to work in their own way.
- Never host database / files / artifacts yourself. 
- Using boring stuff is fun.
- No customer will pay you because you have a great backend, they'll pay you because you solve problems.
- Each project has three phases: Prototype, Production, Optimization. 
- Prototype is a hypothesis: If we do x, we expect people to do y. Describe what is expected outcome of this prototype and kill it if expected outcome is not met.
- There are always things that are important, and that are not important. If you evaluate what you're doing and finding you're telling yourself that "It will be useful in a years time" it probably is not important.
- Start with the end in the mind: If you're building for user, think about what user would like to see/do. If you want to pick holiday, think about possible holidays, pick the one you liked the most and move backwards from there.
- When you're building something new, ask yourself what is the "hello world" of this thing, i.e. what is the simplest form of this problem that if it was available we would be able to build on top of it.
- When you don't know what you're building, work with other people.
- As an IC, try not to "a particular problem is easy to solve in a non-elegant way, hard to solve in an elegant way, so let's redesign this" trap. Unless, the time difference between redesign + elegant implementation and non-elegant implementation is very small, go with non-elegant one.
- Each User Story should include at least 3 sections: Context, Acceptance Criteria, Error Handling. Without error handling, the work would only include happy path scenarios.
- Meetings should start with an agenda. You need to talk about that agenda only. They should end with a set of action items, within the pre-defined timeframe.
- People are conflict-averse. If you want to create a functional team, you need to create an environment where ideas can be shared without confrontation.
- Complaint is useless. You need to make sure people can recommend changes for the company, and those recommendations are evaluated. Easiest way to make that happen is, treating your code of conduct as actual code. Then people can change it with PRs.
- When you're down, work together with other people.
- The more repeated interactions you have, the more trust your team will have to each other. Make sure people share things outside of work.
