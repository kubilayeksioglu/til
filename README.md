## Hiring

- Your biggest cost will always be salaries. Delay hiring until you have funding (or income).
- It's always cheaper to buy, instead of to build (or host). Because you have no idea if what you're building would stick. Additionally most tools are per head, and when you've small number of people cost is small as well.
- If you have funding, hire to decrease your workload, not to increase your capacity. Keeping your team at 80% capacity and allowing people a 20% margin to improve their work makes wonders. Example: If you have a task that would take 4 days, give people 5 days. Your team members would use that 1 day to (re)think about task and perfect their craft. 
- If everyone is working at full capacity, they cannot grow. You need to allow your team to explore, instead of full exploitation.
- You should always look for hires, even if you're not hiring. Similar to customers, you need a hiring pipeline. Otherwise, one of your team members will leave and you'll be in a tough position. In these moments, you'll be thankful previous relatively light workloads because your team will still have one more gear to use.
- It's cheaper to make your current employees happy, rather than finding new ones. On average, a new employee will take 3 months to reach their 4th gear.

## Architecture

- Never host database / files / artifacts yourself. 

## Customer Value

- No customer will pay you because you have a great backend, they'll pay you because you solve problems.
- Each project has three phases: Prototype, Production, Optimization. 
- Prototype is a hypothesis: If we do x, we expect people to do y. Describe what is expected outcome of this prototype and kill it if expected outcome is not met.

## Problem Solving

- Start with the end in the mind: If you're building for user, think about what user would like to see/do. If you want to pick holiday, think about possible holidays, pick the one you liked the most and move backwards from there.
- When you're building something new, ask yourself what is the "hello world" of this thing, i.e. what is the simplest form of this problem that if it was available we would be able to build on top of it.
